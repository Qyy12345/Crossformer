`main_crossformer` is the entry point of our model and there are other parameters that can be tuned. Here we describe them in detail:
| Parameter name | Description of parameter |
| --- | --- |
| data           | The dataset name                                             |
| root_path      | The root path of the data file (defaults to `./datasets/`)    |
| data_path      | The data file name (defaults to `ETTh1.csv`)                  |
| data_split | Train/Val/Test split, can be ratio (e.g. `0.7,0.1,0.2`) or number (e.g. `16800,2880,2880`), (defaults to `0.7,0.1,0.2`) 
| checkpoints    | Location to store the trained model (defaults to `./checkpoints/`)  |
| in_len | Length of input/history sequence, i.e. $T$ in the paper (defaults to 96) |
| out_len | Length of output/future sequence, i.e. $\tau$ in the paper (defaults to 24) |
| seg_len | Length of each segment in DSW embedding, i.e. $L_{seg}$ in the paper (defaults to 6) |
| win_size | How many adjacent segments to be merged into one in segment merging of HED  (defaults to 2) |
| factor | Number of routers in Cross-Dimension Stage of TSA, i.e. $c$ in the paper (defaults to 10) |
| data_dim | Number of dimensions of the MTS data, i.e. $D$ in the paper (defaults to 7 for ETTh and ETTm) |
| d_model | Dimension of hidden states, i.e. $d_{model}$ in the paper (defaults to 256) |
| d_ff | Dimension of MLP in MSA (defaults to 512) |
| n_heads | Num of heads in MSA (defaults to 4) |
| e_layers | Num of encoder layers, i.e. $N$ in the paper (defaults to 3) |
| dropout | The probability of dropout (defaults to 0.2) |
| num_workers | The num_works of Data loader (defaults to 0) |
| batch_size | The batch size for training and testing (defaults to 32) |
| train_epochs | Train epochs (defaults to 20) |
| patience | Early stopping patience (defaults to 3) |
| learning_rate | The initial learning rate for the optimizer (defaults to 1e-4) |
| lradj | Ways to adjust the learning rate (defaults to `type1`) |
| itr | Experiments times (defaults to 1) |
| save_pred | Whether to save the predicted results. If True, the predicted results will be saved in folder `results` in numpy array form. This will cost a lot time and memory for datasets with large $D$. (defaults to `False`). |
| use_gpu | Whether to use gpu (defaults to `True`) |
| gpu | The gpu no, used for training and inference (defaults to 0) |
| use_multi_gpu | Whether to use multiple gpus (defaults to `False`) |
| devices | Device ids of multile gpus (defaults to `0,1,2,3`) |
